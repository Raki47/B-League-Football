# B-League Football main folder
This folder contains all of the code specific to B-League Football like game logic, all the engine code Is kept seperate In the "engine" folder.

<i>What Is B-League Football?</i>
It all started as a joke that I've gone way too deep Into to back out. At one point my friends all played Football games together, I hopped on voice chat with them but couldn't join them
because I don't have an online services subscription as I completely stopped playing console a while ago, so during the call out I hopped on Unreal Engine 4 to start creating my own
parody version of the game purely out of spite of the games steep price and having to pay for online services. They found It funny and I became set on the challenge, the longer I worked on
creating It, the more serious I became regarding the project.

I'm not sure on the specifics of all the games features and little quirks such as parody aspects like adding powerups and funny special abilities to the players but It's something that I
can create and modify after I get all the essentials of a football/soccer game completed. It will have arcade like controls and gameplay and most likely two gamemodes. a 1v1 mode on a small
field and a correctly sized game mode that adheres to the rules of football (for the most part).

I have also chosen to not Include what console as the my grudge with them applies to all of them anyway and more importantly left out the name of the game I was talking about as It would be
unproffesional to mention despite my negative viewpoints on It being fairly mild (It wouldn't be too hard to guess the game If you are desperate to know).

<i>What Is the design process of the game?</i>
It Is especially Important that I briefly discuss this now as the project Is In an extremely early and empty stage of development but may also help to read towards the end of completion.

- The game Is being written solely In C and utilises the <i>Magna Engine</i>, the Magna Engine Is also being written by me In C with a small chunk In Assembly and a few C++ headers (.hpp)
  being added that allow for It to be more simple to use In C++ game projects, I explain It In far more detail In the other 'README' located In the engine folder.
  
- creating game logic In C should be quite simple and easy, especially after the skill and experience gained after the first and biggest hurdle of creating the engine, most of my engineering
  planning and notes Is written In the engine 'README' previously mentioned.
