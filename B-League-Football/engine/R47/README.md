# R47 2D Renderer
The R47 2D rendering library Is made with the goal of being a lightweight tool for Windows game development with OpenGL. (MacOS support planned for the future).

# External libraries used:
- stb_truetype (Single header library that processes TrueTypes)
- Nuklear (C99 single header library for creating modern UI)
- GLAD (Simplifies the process of managing OpenGL function pointers)
- GLFW (OpenGL library providing some basic functions and window management. I am using a single header version of the library as more external files will only complicate the build process,
 the downside to this being It may cause minor decrease In performance and significantly worse readability)

# What I'm adding myself:
- Image handling
- Matrix functions
<i> Written In C and Assembly </i>
